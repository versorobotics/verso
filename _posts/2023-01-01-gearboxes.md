## Fabrication Methods

Verso arm gearboxes can be fabricated using multiple methods:

- **Laser Cutting**: For precision and clean cuts.
- **3D Printing**: For complex geometries and rapid prototyping.
- **CNC Machining**: For durable and high-strength components.
- **Traditional Milling**: For versatile material choices.

## Material Selection

Choose from a wide range of materials based on your project's needs:

- **Metals**:
  - Aluminum: Lightweight and corrosion-resistant.
  - Steel: High-strength and wear-resistant.
- **Plastics**:
  - ABS: Tough and impact-resistant.
  - Polycarbonate: Transparent and heat-resistant.
- **Composites**: For advanced applications requiring unique properties.
- **Wood**: For cost-effective and lightweight applications.

## Application

The Cycloidal Function Generator was instrumental in creating gearboxes for the Verso arm, ensuring high precision and minimal backlash.

Use the generator to customize gearboxes for your own projects [here](https://versorobotics.com/posts/generator/).
